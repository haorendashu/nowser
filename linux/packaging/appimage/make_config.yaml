# You can specify the shared libraries that you want to bundle with your app
#
# flutter_distributor automatically detects the shared libraries that your app
# depends on, but you can also specify them manually here.
#
# The following example shows how to bundle the libcurl library with your app.
#
# include:
#   - libcurl.so.4
# The builder will copy these shared libraries to appimage, but sometimes these files are links and it will cause appimage run error.
# So i place the file version here, you should change to file name depend on your system.
# You can try to look at these script: ```cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu; ll | grep mpv```
include:
  - libsqlite3.so
  - libsecret-1.so.0.0.0
